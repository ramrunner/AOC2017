## Why more scheme?
Because we love scheme and it's time for advent of code 2017!

## how to run it?
just install chicken scheme, run the csi interpreter from your terminal, 
and run (load "dX-foo.ss"). For now some excercises have the input hardcoded
while others provide a lambda that expects it as an argument.

##installing required eggs
chicken-install -s srfi-1 simple-loops format
